# DebugMod

This is a mod for Hacknet that allows the user to use various debug commands

To report bugs or feature requests, open an issue in the [issues section](https://github.com/haawwkeye/DebugMod/issues/)

Requires Hacknet Pathfinder: https://github.com/Arkhist/Hacknet-Pathfinder#pathfinder

for commands go to wiki or [click here](https://github.com/haawwkeye/DebugMod/wiki/Commands) **THIS IS NOT A FINISHED!**

# DebugMod API

This is planned as I think it would be useful to have an API for developers/modders like pre-made error handling and a DebugLog Command that logs stuff in the console with colors
